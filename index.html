        <h6 style="text-weight: bold;">진심이 담긴 유학원</h6>
        <p>그런데 상담을 하다 보니, 친언니에게 조언을 듣고 상담을 받고 있는 느낌이 들 만큼 편안하고 시원했다. 내가 궁금해하는 부분에 대한 명확한 설명은 물론이고, 자신의 경험을 토대로 실질적인 조언도 정말 많이 해주시고. <br>
        거의 한 시간이 넘는 상담 시간 동안 힘들거나 귀찮은 내색 하나 없이 성심성의껏, 웃으며 이야기해주시고 들어주시는 분이라니 나중에 수속하게 되면 꼭 여기에서 해야겠다는 마음을 절로 먹게 되었지. <br><br>
        구구절절 무슨 eec 유학원 관계자처럼 말이 많지만, 정말 순수하게, 나에게 전달된 진심에 감동했을 뿐이다. 
        </p>
        <p>항상 너무너무 감사했습니다:) 학생 한명한명한테 애정을 가지고 진행해주시는게 느껴졌어요! 아니라면 어떻게 TGV랑 비행기 예약까지 계속 전화받아주셨겠어요 ㅠㅠ 항상 기억하고 감사했습니다!</p>

        <h6 style="text-weight: bold;">Thanks to you, our diabetic kitty is better</h6>
        <p>When Samantha, our Siamese cat, began sleeping all the time and urinating excessively, we brought her to see the specialists at Wisdom. After running a blood test, Dr. Winthrop confirmed what we all feared – Samantha was showing signs of diabetes.</p>
        <p>The doctor put us on a daily routine to give Samantha insulin injections, and showed us how to administer the shots. We weren’t sure we could do it on our own, but the gang at Wisdom helped us through every step, and were always very supportive and encouraging. Now, two years later, Samantha is still free from any complications of diabetes, and her blood sugar regularly tests normal. Thank you, Wisdom Pet Medicine!</p>

        <h6 style="text-weight: bold;">How a dog antibiotic cured our fish</h6>
        <p>Wisdom Pet Medicine is the only clinic around that will even book pet fish for appointments. When our 13-year old goldfish, McAllister, turned from silvery white to an angry red, we called around, urgently trying to find a veterinarian who could help. Wisdom not only got us in the same day, but also was able to diagnose McAllister as having a severe case of septicemia.</p>
        <p>In order to kill the harmful bacteria in his blood, we had to use a dog antibiotic in his tank every day for a week, and in the end, McAllister was good as new. I still smile upon remembering Dr. Chase pulling out an old vet school textbook to calculate the correct antibiotic dose for a fish!</p>

        <h6 style="text-weight: bold;">Caring for Roxie, the grape-loving dog</h6>
        <p>The staff at Wisdom worked tirelessly to determine why our three-year old Labrador Retriever, Roxie, started going into sudden kidney failure. They stabilized her and provided fluids until her kidneys were again functioning normal, but it was still a mystery as to what caused her health to decline so quickly.</p>
        <p>The vet noted our address on Roxie’s chart, and asked if we lived on one of the orchards in the vicinity, and if Roxie had a habit of eating grapes off the vine. Our answer was “of course – she’s a Labrador.” That day we learned just how toxic grapes and raisins are to pets, and Roxie is no longer allowed to roam unattended in the orchard.</p>
